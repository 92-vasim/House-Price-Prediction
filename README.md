# House Price Prediction Project

## Introduction

This markdown document serves as documentation for the House Price Prediction project. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on relevant features. This document will outline the project's objectives, data sources, methodology, and results.

## Project Objectives

1. Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts house prices.
2. Analyze and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
3. Select and implement appropriate machine learning algorithms.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics.
5. Create a user-friendly interface for users to input house features and get price predictions.

## Data Sources

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains 81 and 1460 samples. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with 0.9 used for training and 0.1 used for testing.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers as needed.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features, encode categorical variables, and scale/normalize numerical features.
3. **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Model Selection

Several machine learning algorithms will be explored for this regression problem. The following models will be considered:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost

## Model Training

1. Implement and train each selected model using the training dataset.
2. Tune hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search or random search.
3. Evaluate model performance using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error).

## Model Evaluation

1. Compare the performance of different models using a suitable evaluation metric.
2. Visualize the model's predictions against the actual house prices (e.g., scatter plots).
3. Identify the best-performing model for deployment.

## Model Deployment

1. Develop a user-friendly web interface using Gradio.
2. Deploy the chosen model to the web interface.
3. Allow users to input house features and receive real-time price predictions.

## Conclusion

This project aims to create an accurate house price prediction model and make it accessible to users through a user-friendly web interface. By following the outlined steps, we will achieve our project objectives and deliver a valuable tool for predicting house prices.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional data sources for more accurate predictions.
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques and deep learning models.
- Continuously update and improve the web interface for better user experience.
